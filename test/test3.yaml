      description: Currently the API cannot differentiate between a lead rejected due to server error or one rejected due to bad email address. The lead system requires email addresses that are correctly formatted to cut down on garbage accounts, and they need to have a valid MX record. Most 500 error from this method are a result of bad email addresses. In future versions we will differentiate the error and make the MX record requirement optional.
